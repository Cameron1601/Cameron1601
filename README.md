Welcome to my GitHub, I am a Software Development Student at the University Of Ottawa. Currently, I am working on developing a 2.5D platform game within Unity. I am always looking to collaborate on projects built with C++, Python, Java, Unity, or Unreal Engine 5. I am open to helping with projects that allow me to improve my skills as a developer.
